          </ul>

          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          Making at Crème Brûlée home couldn't be easier! Here's how you'll make it:
          <ol>
            <li>Adjust an oven rack to the lower middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees.</li>
            <li>Combine 2 cups of the cream, the sugar, and salt to a medium saucepan. With a pairing knife, scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the pan, submerge the pod in the cream, 
and bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to ensure that the sugar dissolves. Take the pan off hte heat and let steep for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place a kitchen towel on the bottom of a large baking dish or roasting pan and arrange eight 4- or 5- ounce ramekins on the towel (making sure they don't touch). 
Bring a kettle or large saucepan of water to a boil.</li>
            <li> After the vanilla bean has steeped, stir in the remaining 2 cups cream to cool down the mixture. Whisk the egg yolks in a large bowl until broken up and combined. 
Whisk about 1 cup of the cream mixture into the yolks until loosened and combined; repeat with 1 cup more of cream. Ad the remeaning cream and whisk until evenly colored and throughly combined.
Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a large measuring cup or pitcher; discard solids in the strainer. Pour or ladle the mixture into the ramekins, dividing evenly amoung them. </li>
            <li>Carefully place the baking dish with the ramekins on the oven rack; pour the boiling water into the disk, taking care not to spalsh water into the ramekins, until the water reaches
two-thirds of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until the centers of the custards are just barely set and are no longer sloshy and register 170 to 175 degrees on an instant read thermometer,
30 to 35 minutes. Begin checking temperature about 5 minutes before recommended time</li>
            <li>Transfer ramekins to a wire rack and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Set the ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refridgerate until cold,
at least 4 hours or up to 4 days</li>
            <li>Uncover the ramekins; if condensation has collected on the custards, blot the moisture with a paper towel. Sprinkle each with about 1 teaspoon sugar; tilt and tap each ramekin for even
coverage. Ignite a torch and caramelize the sugar. Refridgerate teh ramekins, uncovered, to rechill, 30 to 45 minutes; serve. </li>
